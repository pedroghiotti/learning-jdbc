# Sample Maven / Java project following along with the LinkedInLearning course [Learning JDBC](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-jdbc-24697410)

## Setup
### Project structure
The project's base structure was generated by the following Maven command:
```
mvn archetype:generate "-DgroupId=com.pedroghiotti.learning" "-DartifactId=learning-jdbc" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart" "-DarchetypeVersion=1.5" "-DinteractiveMode=false"
```

### DB Setup
The project's database, for development purposes, runs on a docker container in my local machine.
The commands utilized in setting up said container were the following:
```
docker pull postgres

docker run --name "learning-jdbc-pg" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pgpw -d -p 5432:5432 -v ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

## Project Organization and Patterns
### DAOs
- Abstraction layer between JDBC and the rest of the application code;
- May be a true object, although it does not have to be implemented as such (this is the case for this project);
- Often coupled with DTOs;
- Usually leverages a common interface;
- Concrete implementation reacts on a single data domain;
- Can and usually does support multiple tables;
- Encapsulates complex joins and aggregations;

### DAO Factories
- Provide the ability to leverage common paths for basic CRUD operations;
- Loses value when a lot of custom methods start being introduced;

### DTOs
- Provides single domain data (meaning that it can carry data from a single model or a join between different tables, though always within the same domain);
- Should fully encapsulate the object it means to represent, including sub-objects;
- Should be the output/input of a single DAO;
